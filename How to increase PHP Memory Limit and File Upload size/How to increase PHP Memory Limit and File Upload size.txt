How to increase PHP Memory Limit and File Upload size

Increasing PHP Memory Limit and File Upload size

For WAMP

While importing a large database in PHP MyAdmin, or any other MySQL interface,we face server time out or maybe the file upload size is limited to say 2 MB or so. All you need to do is, you have to edit you php.ini file to increase the PHP memory limit and the file upload size. If you are using WAMP the follow the steps:


Go to php.ini  using GUI

Or

C:\wamp\bin\apache\apache2.2.8\bin\php.ini (go to the respective directory if WAMP is installed in a different location)


Find below configuration

    post_max_size = 8M
    upload_max_filesize = 2M
    max_execution_time = 30
    max_input_time = 60
    memory_limit = 8M

Modify to:

    post_max_size = 750M
    upload_max_filesize = 750M
    max_execution_time = 5000
    max_input_time = 5000
    memory_limit = 1000M
