The app uses Twitter Bootstrap for some functionality, Fabric.js for most of the HTML5 Canvas functionality, LESS for the CSS preprocessing (a compiled CSS version is what the application uses in production), Handlebars for the front-end templating, and the Slim PHP framework for the backend RESTful API, and as I said, it's using SQLite3 for the database (the database is a single file in the /api directory and SQLite databases do not require a password).
